title: Why Pharmacy?

##Why do you want to be a pharmacist?

I gravitated towards healthcare. 

Typically, I'm not one for glare of the limelight. Thus, after reaffirming my healthcare-aspirations at the EMS, I looked for roles where I could continue to act as a member of a team. In looking for a support role, I realized that the pharmacist was always there as a knowledgable resource.
