title: Why Pharmacy?

##Why do you want to be a pharmacist?

I've gravitated towards healthcare for most of my childhood, and as a result, considered becoming a nurse, a paramedic, or a physician. However, my introverted personality reminded me that  I didn't want to be on the front-lines, but rather, would prefer to be a supporting member of the healthcare cast. I eventually settled for pharmacy school. Even throughout the first few years, I was still never truly sold on the idea of becoming a pharmacist. 

It was during my experiential rotations that I began to grow into being a pharmacist. From working with physicians to optimize medication therapy and teaching patients how to manage their complex drug regimen, I found that I enjoyed helping to educate patients and working to improve the quality of their care. It was at this point that I knew I had arrived at my career.

I knew that I wanted to continue Working with patients and clinically enhancing their care. Even though it took me a while to find my rationale for becoming a pharmacist, I am now confident that I am on the right track.
