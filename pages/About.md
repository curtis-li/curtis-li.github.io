Hey there! I'm Curtis, a prospective 2016 graduate of the [Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy](http://pharmacy.rutgers.edu). I'm currently in my final year in the 6-year pharmacy doctorate program, and am currently finishing up my experiential rotations.




My other interests include rock climbing and photography.
I hope you'll spend some time here to learn more about me.
