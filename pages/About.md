Hey there! I'm Curtis, a prospective 2016 graduate of the [Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy](http://pharmacy.rutgers.edu). I'm currently in my final year of the 6-year pharmacy doctorate program, and am in the process of finishing up my experiential rotations.

My hobbies include rock climbing and photography. Right now, my side projects include teaching myself to code a website (HTML, CSS) and a research study on the effects of pharmacy classwork.

I hope you'll spend some time here to learn more about me. You can download a copy of my CV [here](../../files/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf). Connect with me on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/curtislipharmd) or reach out to me through [email](mailto:curtisfanli@gmail.com)!
